  <td> To build native Android apps or have existing Java codebases</td>
    <td> It uses a single codebase to create a consistent and visually appealing u across both Android and iOS platforms</td>
     <td> Its best to create a consistent cross-platform experience, it can sometimes lead to subtle UI differences between Android and iOS </td>

    <td>Java apps generally offer good performance, especially for computationally intensive or resource-intensive applications.</td>
    <td>  Known for its excellent performance due to its direct compilation to native code and its use of the Skia graphics engine for rendering</td>
    <td>Offers good performance,for UI-related tasks. However, it does rely on a JavaScript bridge for communication with native modules, which can introduce slight overhead in some cases.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The "Hot Reload" feature is not available in Java as a built-in feature of the language itself. </td>
    <td>Flutter's "Hot Reload" feature can enhance development efficiency, allowing developers to see instant results of code changes</td>
    <td>React Native also offers "Fast Refresh" for rapid development, but it may not be as seamless as Flutter's "Hot Reload.</td>

Looking at the above features,Flutter would be suitable choice for developing a hotel-management app.
